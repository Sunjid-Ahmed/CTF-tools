# CTF Tools

A collection of tools and scripts to assist with Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges. This repository includes utilities for various CTF categories such as cryptography, reverse engineering, forensics, web exploitation, and more.

## Features

- Scripts for common CTF tasks
- Tools for encoding/decoding, hashing, and encryption analysis
- Automated exploit scripts
- Utilities for binary analysis and reverse engineering
- Web security testing tools

## Installation

To use these tools, clone the repository and ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ctf-tools.git
cd ctf-tools
pip install -r requirements.txt  # If applicable
```

## Usage

Each tool has its own usage instructions. Navigate to the respective directories and check the scripts.

Example:

```sh
python crypto/decryptor.py -i encrypted.txt
```
